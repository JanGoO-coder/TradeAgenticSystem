### ICT / Smart Money Concepts — Complete Rulebook (Hierarchical)

Below is a structured, rulebook-style hierarchy of ICT (Inner Circle Trader) / Smart Money Concepts suitable for building an algorithm, automation, or a disciplined discretionary system. Each rule states **What**, **Why**, **When valid**, and **When invalid**. Items are strictly ICT/SMC — no non-ICT indicators or invented concepts.

## 1 Market Framework

### 1.1 Higher Timeframe Bias (Intraday)

What: Define market bias using **1H swing highs and swing lows only**.

Why: 1H provides sufficient institutional structure for intraday trend delivery.

When valid: Clear 1H structure exists (HH/HL or LH/LL) or a confirmed 1H MSS is present.

When invalid: 1H price is overlapping, ranging, or lacks a decisive structure break.

---

### 1.1.1 Clear 1H Structure Rule

What: Trades are allowed only when 1H structure is clean and directional.

Why: Prevents trading inside manipulation and consolidation.

When valid: 1H shows a candle close beyond a confirmed swing high or low.

When invalid: Structure breaks without displacement or occurs inside internal ranges.

---

### 1.1.2 Intraday Bias Lock

What: Once 1H bias is set, it remains fixed until invalidated.

Why: Avoids bias flipping during normal pullbacks.

When valid: No opposing 1H MSS has formed.

When invalid: A confirmed opposite 1H MSS or major session/news reset occurs.

---

### 1.2 Timeframe Alignment (1H → 15M)

What: 15M must align with 1H directional bias.

Why: 15M delivers execution, not direction.

When valid: 15M forms continuation structure in direction of 1H bias.

When invalid: 15M forms a confirmed MSS against 1H bias.

---

## 1.2.1 External vs Internal Structure

What: 1H defines external structure; 15M defines internal structure.

Why: Prevents lower timeframe noise from overriding HTF intent.

When valid: 15M pullbacks remain corrective within 1H direction.

When invalid: 15M creates impulsive structure against 1H.

---

### 1.2.2 Counter-Trend Restriction

What: Counter-trend trades are prohibited without 1H MSS.

Why: Most reversals fail without higher timeframe confirmation.

When valid: Liquidity sweep → 1H displacement → confirmed 1H MSS.

When invalid: Any counter-trend setup without full 1H confirmation.

---

### 1.2.3 Intraday-Only Scope

What: All trades must complete within the same trading day.

Why: System is designed for scalping and intraday expansion only.

When valid: Trades align with active session liquidity.

When invalid: Setups relying on multi-day continuation.

---

## 2 Directional Bias Rules

### 2.1 Market Structure (MS)

What: Identify swing highs and swing lows to define directional structure.

Why: Structure determines trend direction and liquidity positioning.

When valid: Clear swings exist forming HH/HL or LH/LL.

When invalid: Price overlaps with no clean swing definition.

---

### 2.2 Break in Market Structure (BMS)

What: Price closes beyond a confirmed swing high or swing low.

Why: Indicates continuation or expansion toward liquidity.

When valid: Break occurs with displacement and body close beyond structure.

When invalid: Break occurs without follow-through or immediately re-enters structure.

---

### 2.3 Market Structure Shift (MSS)

What: First break against the previous trend after liquidity is taken.

Why: Signals potential change in order flow.

When valid: Liquidity sweep occurs followed by strong displacement and structure break.

When invalid: Break occurs without liquidity sweep or without displacement.

---

### 2.4 Dealing Range (Accumulation / Distribution)

What: Defined range where price trades between clear high and low boundaries.

Why: Institutions build positions before expansion.

When valid: Price respects range boundaries without external structure break.

When invalid: Range is broken with decisive displacement and continuation.

---

## 3 Liquidity Concepts

### 3.1 Buy-Side & Sell-Side Liquidity

What: Buy-side liquidity rests above highs; sell-side liquidity rests below lows.

Why: Institutions move price toward liquidity to generate expansion.

When valid: Clear swing highs/lows or session highs/lows are present.

When invalid: Liquidity levels exist during thin or inactive sessions.

---

### 3.2 Equal Highs / Equal Lows

What: Multiple highs or lows formed at similar price levels.

Why: Creates pooled stop liquidity.

When valid: Levels are clearly visible and repeatedly respected.

When invalid: Market is trending aggressively without revisits.

---

## 3.3 Inducement

What: Price creates a false move to trap traders before the real expansion.

Why: Used to build liquidity for institutional entries.

When valid: Price moves into obvious levels then sharply reverses.

When invalid: Price continues cleanly through the level.

---

### 3.4 Stop Hunt

What: Intentional sweep of buy-side or sell-side liquidity.

Why: Triggers stops to fuel directional movement.

When valid: Liquidity is taken followed by displacement.

When invalid: Liquidity is taken without reaction or continuation.

---

### 3.5 Liquidity Void

What: Fast price movement leaving little or no overlap.

Why: Represents imbalance likely to be revisited or extended.

When valid: Created by strong displacement candles.

When invalid: Formed during news spikes or low-volume periods.

---

## 4 Price Delivery Models

### 4.1 Expansion → Retracement → Continuation (ERC)

What: Price expands, retraces into value, then continues in the same direction.

Why: Institutions rebalance orders before continuation.

When valid: Strong displacement followed by controlled retracement into FVG, OB, or PD zone.

When invalid: Expansion occurs without retracement or structural sequence.

---

### 4.2 Power of Three (PO3)

What: Price moves through accumulation, manipulation, then distribution.

Why: Explains institutional order building and release.

When valid: Clear range forms, liquidity is swept, then directional expansion occurs.

When invalid: No defined accumulation or manipulation phase exists.

---

## 5 Fair Value Tools & Order Blocks

### 5.1 Premium & Discount (PD Arrays)

What: Price zones defining expensive (premium) and cheap (discount) relative to range.

Why: Institutions sell high and buy low.

When valid: Clear reference range exists with directional bias.

When invalid: No defined range or structure.

*Note: Lever (0), Level (0.5), Level (1). If it is bullish then 0 to 0.5 is Discount and 0.5 to 1 is Premium. And if bearish then 0 to 0.5 is Premium and 0.5 to 1 is Discount.* 

---

### 5.2 Fair Value Gap (FVG)

What: Imbalance created by strong displacement leaving price inefficiency.

Why: Represents unfilled institutional orders.

When valid: Created by displacement and aligned with structure and liquidity.

When invalid: Formed inside consolidation or without displacement.

---

### 5.3 Balanced Price Range (BPR)

What: Area where price trades in equilibrium.

Why: Indicates acceptance, not delivery.

When valid: Price oscillates without structure break.

When invalid: Structure breaks with displacement.

---

### 5.4 Order Block (OB)

What: Last opposing candle before strong displacement.

Why: Marks institutional order origin.

When valid: Aligned with bias and unmitigated.

When invalid: Previously mitigated or against structure.

---

## 5.5 Mitigation Block

What: Order block revisited and partially filled.

Why: Confirms institutional interest.

When valid: Price reacts after mitigation.

When invalid: Price passes through without response.

---

### 5.6 Breaker Block

What: Failed order block that flips direction.

Why: Acts as new supply or demand.

When valid: Structure flips and block holds on retest.

When invalid: No reaction or structure not shifted.

---

## 6 Entry Models

### 6.1 Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)

What: Retracement entry into optimal discount or premium zone.

Why: Institutions re-enter after manipulation.

---

### 6.2 Fair Value Gap (FVG) Entry

What: Entry on retrace into displacement-created FVG.

Why: Targets unfilled institutional orders.

When valid: FVG formed by displacement and aligned with liquidity.

When invalid: FVG is mitigated or lacks displacement.

---

### 6.3 Liquidity Sweep → Displacement → FVG

What: Entry after liquidity is taken and price displaces into imbalance.

Why: Captures continuation after manipulation.

When valid: Clear sweep, strong displacement, clean FVG retest.

When invalid: Sweep unclear or displacement weak.

---

### 6.4 MSS + OTE Entry

What: Enter OTE after confirmed market structure shift.

Why: Confirms new directional order flow.
