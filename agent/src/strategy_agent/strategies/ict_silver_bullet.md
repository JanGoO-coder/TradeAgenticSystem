# ICT Silver Bullet Strategy

## Trading Rules

1.  **Time Window**:
    - Only look for trades during the New York Silver Bullet window (10:00 AM - 11:00 AM EST).

2.  **Bias**:
    - Trade in the direction of the immediate (1H/15M) market structure.
    - If Market Structure is Bullish (Higher Highs, Higher Lows), look for BUYS.
    - If Market Structure is Bearish (Lower Lows, Lower Highs), look for SELLS.

3.  **Entry Criteria**:
    - **Bullish**: Price must retrace into a Bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG).
    - **Bearish**: Price must retrace into a Bearish Fair Value Gap (FVG).

4.  **Execution**:
    - Enter immediately when price touches the FVG.
    - Stop Loss: 5 handles (or below/above the invalidation swing).
    - Take Profit: Next Liquidity Level (Swing High/Low).

5.  **Constraints**:
    - Do NOT trade if there is High Impact News within 15 minutes.
